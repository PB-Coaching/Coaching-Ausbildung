Hello Ewa, 


here is my proposal on how we can conduct coaching together.

First the general framework:

A coaching cycle encompasses between 10-12 sessions. As it is difficult for clients as well as me to forecast the exact number of sessions needed to reach the client's objective at the beginning, I propose to agree on 10 sessions and make a first review after 5 sessions and a second review after 8 sessions. From experience after 8 sessions the client and the coach can determine at this point in time whether more than 10 sessions are needed. Having a coaching cycle stretch over 12 sessions is not sensible in most situation, the client should have arrived at her/his goal or achieved clarification on topics of her/his choosing during the coaching sessions. Coaching is not long-term therapy earning money for the coach.

In some cases it might make to initiate a second coaching cycle, but at least 8 months should have passed since the termination of the previous one. I know this is not your situation, but I mention it so have a clearer idea of what my understanding of coaching is.

You do not need to have clear objective before the coaching. Defining goals is part of coaching.
