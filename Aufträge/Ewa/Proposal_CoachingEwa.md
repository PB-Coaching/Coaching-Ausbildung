Hello Ewa, 


here is my proposal on how we can conduct coaching together.

First the general framework:


## Duration
A coaching cycle encompasses between 10-12 sessions. As it is difficult for clients as well as me to forecast the exact number of sessions needed to reach the client's objective at the beginning, I propose to agree on 10 sessions and make a first review after 5 sessions and a second review after 8 sessions. These reviews are important in any way to see if we are heading in the right direction or need to adjust the course. From experience after 8 sessions the client and the coach can determine at this point in time whether more than 10 sessions are needed. Having a coaching cycle stretch over 12 sessions is not sensible in most situation, the client should have arrived at her/his goal or achieved clarification on topics of her/his choosing during the coaching sessions. Coaching is not long-term therapy earning money for the coach.

In some cases it might make sense to initiate a second coaching cycle, but at least 8 months should have passed since the termination of the previous one. I know this is not your situation, but I mention it so have a clearer idea of what my understanding of coaching is.


## Objectives & Content
You do not need to have clear objective before starting the coaching. Defining goals is part of coaching;) You alone decide about which topics you want to talk about. At every point you have the right to refuse to go deeper into a topic, end the coaching session immediately and also end the complete coaching cycle.

Do not worry, you do not have to come with problems to me. Coaching is about positive solution focus, not so much about problems. Especially in the first session I employ a tool which is entirely focused on the client's strength. Starting from this assessment it is normally easy for client to decide in which direction they want to work.

From my side, I commit to being always clear about the methods and tools I intend to employ in a coaching session. I will never try to manipulate you or push your thoughts into a specific directions. I do not have any training in NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) as this is against coaching ethics.


## Privacy
We coaches work on the basis of trust. This means what is said during coaching sessions stays there. Under no circumstances will I share any details about our coaching. In case you wish so, I will not even mention it taking place to my coaching federation. There we have to give anonymized accounts of our coaching work for supervision work. But this is always based on the client's agreement and not even an anonymized account will be shared without your consent. Before we will start coaching I will provide you with a written statement to this effect.

## Documentation
I take a protocol of each coaching session, these protocols I will share with you after the coaching cycle is finished. In addition to a final feedback questionnaire which I will ask you to fill out, these protocols are also meant for your review. It helps us both to reflect our work and give opportunities to clarify things where different perceptions might have occured.


## Performing the coaching sessions
Due to the distance we will have to do most coaching sessions remotely as a video conference. Nonetheless, I propose to do some coaching sessions in person. The first and last sessions would be suitable candidates from my point of view and maybe a review session in between. What do you think?

A coaching session lasts between 1,5 and 2 hours. This depends on the tools used and topics covered. From experience I almost never had sessions lasting less than 90 minutes and doing coaching for more 2 hours is also rare.

I found a nice online whiteboard solution, which I am still testing if it fits our needs. Nonetheless for in-person sessions and also for yourself it will be a good idea to organize some index card to taking notes. This helps enormously for visualizing ideas and getting the 'picture'.

For a coaching session you should have a quiet surrounding ;)

As you mentioned one coaching session per month looks good. A rule of thumb is to have coaching in 2-4 week intervals.

Before the first session I suggest to have talk about your expectations and questions about coaching. There we can also discuss the details on how to conduct the coaching and any other things which might come up.


## Remuneration

A coaching session done remotely is 400 PLN. For an in-person coaching with travelling to Łódz it is 600 PLN plus travel costs. Payment is 3 coaching sessions in advance with the last installment being 4 sessions in case of 10 sessions per cycle, with 12 coaching sessions the 3 coaching sessions in advance mode stays in place.


## Agreement

I will prepare a written agreement about the coaching a general time frame, above mentioned privacy rules, documentation, remuneration as well a statement of non-disclosure from my side.

## Responsibilities

Coaching work is alwas team work. A coach is like a navigator taking the ship to the direction the captain wants it to sail to. This means both sides have their distinct responsibilities. My task is to provide the most appropriate tools and methods to my best knowledge to support you in your coaching work. This coaching work on the other hand is your sole responsibility. You are doing the reflection work.
